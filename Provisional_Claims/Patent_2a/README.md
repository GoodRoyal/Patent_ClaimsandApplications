# Patent 2a: Substrate Orchestration System

**Application:** Physical/Gravitational Substrate Orchestration via Perpendicular Divergence  
**Applicant:** Juan Carlos Paredes / Entropy Systems  
**Filed:** October 29, 2025

---

## Abstract

This patent extends the perpendicular divergence framework to physical and gravitational systems, introducing the elemental compatibility factor (ξ) for orchestrating processes across different material substrates.

---

## Core Formula

```
D⊥(Si, Sj) = D_KL(Pi|Pj) × (1 - |⟨ui, uj⟩|) × ξ(Ei, Ej)
```

Where:
- `Si, Sj` are substrate states
- `Pi, Pj` are probability distributions over state variables
- `⟨ui, uj⟩` is the inner product of direction vectors
- `ξ(Ei, Ej) = exp(-Δχ²ij / 2σ²χ)` is the elemental compatibility factor
